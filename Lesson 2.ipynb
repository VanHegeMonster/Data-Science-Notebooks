    "1) Data science is defined as making logical conclusions from large sets of data by way of using exploration, prediction, and inference. In my cadet career or the big AF, this can be used where large sets of test data is collected to solve a problem. By exploring different associations and generating a variety of predictions, we can work towards establishing causality to the greatest degree possible."
