## Data-Science-Notebooks
#### These are for Math377. Expect more to come as I write and work through more. I intend to comment my code as much as possible. When you see a python notebook that says lab01 for example, it came from edx Data8 course. All others titled lessonX are coded according to the problems and documents posted in USAFA Math 377 google drive.
##### All worked solutions are coded by my fingers only with an occassional assistance from Dr. Google, StackOverflow, and data8.org regarding particular syntax and test examples.
